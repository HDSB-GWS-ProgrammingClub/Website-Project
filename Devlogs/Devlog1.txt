-Adam Devlog Jan.21st, 2021
    Mr.Brooks approved the addition of the website to the school's website.
    The website can be linked under the "Clubs and Councils" tab. 
    It can go under our banner for the club, Jason's already taken care of that part. I like the banner, should probably even add it to the site somewhere.

    Project planning is going to be tackled with a 'learn and live' approach. 
    This is an opportunity to try github project boards as well as Callum's suggestion to use "Trello" which looks good. 
    Managing a team for a school project requires some lenience because many members have school commitments.
    This means that the development plan needs to be detailed enough to hit it's goals but flexible enough to allow some room for setbacks.
    As of the time of this devlog, summatives are coming up so I expect development to be somewhat consistent so likely only the HTML(content) will be done.
    Anyone with more knowledge of CSS than me can add the styling in.
    CSS is the bulk of website code, the main real challange will be the JavaScript footer and the collaboration aspect. 
    Most high school programmers have no idea how to work on a team, despite the job of a programmer being done mainly as part of development teams. 
    Learning how to collaborate on team projects is however, one of the main focuses of this club.
    

    Hosting the website:
    There's no solid plan for website hosting yet but I am considering a few options.
    It won't be a problem. 
    Once I decide on one I'll announce it.
