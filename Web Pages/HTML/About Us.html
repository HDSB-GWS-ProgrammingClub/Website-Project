    About Us:
</h1>
<!-- Remember to add in a section detailing how the club works.-->
<p1>
    We are a group of high school programmers united by our interests in programming and computer science. 
    We work together on many different projects such as: websites, video games, applications and much more...

<!-- 
This is the "how we operate" section
This section describes how membership works. Probably going to change this a couple times before the website is deployed
-->
<p2>
	The club welcomes anyone with an intrest in programming and computer science, prior programming experiance is not needed.
	Those who join without programming knowledge get access to guidance, tools and resources via the club discord to help get started with coding.
	Experianced programmers joining the club, as in those who have taken a computer science course or learned on their own can become part of the Senior Coders and work on either
	team or independant projects within the club's Github organization. 
	There is no specific programming language that club members are expected to use or to know, however the recommended language for begginers is Python.
	Python is very versitle, relatively simple to learn and is taught at school. This makes it (in our opinion) the ideal choice.
